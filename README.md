# BitPay Library for Ruby [![](https://secure.travis-ci.org/bitpay/ruby-client.png)](http://travis-ci.org/bitpay/ruby-client) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/bitpay-sdk.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/bitpay-sdk)
Powerful, flexible, lightweight interface to the BitPay Bitcoin Payment Gateway API.

## Installation

    gem install bitpay-sdk
    
In your Gemfile:

    gem 'bitpay-sdk', :require => 'bitpay_sdk'

Or directly:

    require 'bitpay_sdk'

## Configuration

The bitpay client creates a cryptographically secure connection to your server by pairing an API code with keys generated by the library. The client can be initialized with pre-existing keys passed in as a pem file, or paired if initialized with a pem file and a tokens hash. Examples can be found in the cucumber step helpers.

## Command-line Interface (CLI)

BitPay also provides a command-line interface (CLI) which can be used to generate client-side cryptographic credentials and for client pairing with the BitPay service.  Generally speaking, this is the easiest way to pair your client.  The library must be installed as a local gem.

    gem install bitpay-client
    
Source code and documentation for the Ruby CLI can be found at https://github.com/bitpay/ruby-cli

## Client Setup

### Pairing with Bitpay.com

Most calls to the BitPay REST API require that your client is paired with the bitpay.com server.  To pair with bitpay.com you need to have an approved merchant account.

Your client can be paired via the `pos` (point-of-sale) or `merchant` facade (or both).  The `pos` facade allows for invoices to be created.  The `merchant` facade has broader privileges to view all invoices, bills, and ledger entries, as well as to issue refunds.  Consider the level of access required when you pair your client.

Pairing can be performed via two separate methods:

#### To initiate pairing from the server
_Suited for POS clients where pre-authorized tokens are desirable_

1. Login to your account  
2. Navigate to bitpay.com/api-tokens (Dashboard > My Account > API Tokens)  
3. Create a new token and copy the pairing code.  
4. Use the bitpay command line tool to pair with bitpay.com `bitpay pair <pairing_code>`

#### To initiate pairing from the client 
_Suited to API clients that need merchant facade access_

1. Use the BitPay command line interface to generate a pairing code: 
`bitpay pair` or `bitpay pair --test` for the BitPay [test server](https://test.bitpay.com)
2. Login to your account via the provided pairing URL and select the appropriate label and facade.

```
$ bitpay pair

   Pairing code for https://bitpay.com: 2mLZjPZ.
   Visit the link below to pair your client and select a facade:

  https://bitpay.com/api-access-request?pairingCode=2mLZjPZ
```

### Pairing Programattically

If you are developing a client which requires built-in pairing capability, or have other reason not to use the CLI, you can pair programattically.  The example below demonstrates this using a locally generated PEM file using OpenSSL and the irb tool.

```
$ gem install bitpay-sdk
Successfully installed bitpay-sdk-2.2.0
1 gem installed
$ openssl ecparam -genkey -name secp256k1 -noout -out bitpaykey.pem
$ irb
2.1.1 :001 > require 'bitpay_sdk'
 => true 
2.1.1 :002 > client = BitPay::SDK::Client.new(api_uri: 'https://test.bitpay.com', pem: File.read('bitpaykey.pem'), insecure: true)
 => #<BitPay::SDK::Client:0x000000019c6d40 @pem="---... @tokens={}> 
2.1.1 :003 > client.pair_client()
 => {"data"=>[{"policies"=>[{"policy"=>"id", "method"=>"inactive", "params"=>["Tf49SFeiUAtytFEW2EUqZgWj32nP51PK73M"]}], "token"=>"BKQyVdaGQZAArdkkSuvtZN5gcN2355c8vXLj5eFPkfuK", "dateCreated"=>1422474475162, "pairingExpiration"=>1422560875162, "pairingCode"=>"Vy76yTh"}]} 
```

As with the client-initiated pairing example above, use the value from the `pairingCode` element to register for the appropriate facade

## General Usage

### Initialize the client

    client = BitPay::SDK::Client.new(pem: File.read('bitpaykey.pem')
    
Optional parameters:
 * `api_uri` - specify a different api endpoint (e.g. 'https://test.bitpay.com').  Ensure no trailing slash.
 * `tokens` - pass a stored hash of bitpay API tokens
 * `user-agent` - specify a custom user-agent value
 * `debug: true` - enable HTTP request logging to $stdout
 * `insecure: true` - disable HTTPs certificate validation (for local test environments)

### Create a new bitcoin invoice

    invoice = client.create_invoice (price: <price>, currency: <currency>)

With invoice creation, `price` and `currency` are the only required fields. If you are sending a customer from your website to make a purchase, setting `redirectURL` will redirect the customer to your website when the invoice is paid.

Response will be a hash with information on your newly created invoice. Send your customer to the `url` to complete payment:

```
{
  "url": "https://bitpay.com/invoice?id=NKaqMuZWy3BAcP77RdkEEv",
  "paymentUrls": {
    "BIP21": "bitcoin:mvYRECDxKPaPHnjNz9ZxiTpbx29xYNoRy4?amount=0.3745",
    "BIP72": "bitcoin:mvYRECDxKPaPHnjNz9ZxiTpbx29xYNoRy4?amount=0.3745&r=https://bitpay.com/i/NKaqMuZWy3BAcP77RdkEEv",
    "BIP72b": "bitcoin:?r=https://bitpay.com/i/NKaqMuZWy3BAcP77RdkEEv",
    "BIP73": "https://bitpay.com/i/NKaqMuZWy3BAcP77RdkEEv"
  },
  "status": "new",
  "btcPrice": "0.3745",
  "btcDue": "0.3745",
  "price": 148,
  "currency": "USD",
  "exRates": {
    "USD": 395.20000000000005
  },
  "invoiceTime": 1415987168612,
  "expirationTime": 1415988068612,
  "currentTime": 1415987168629,
  "guid": "438e8237-fff1-483c-81b4-dc7dba28922a",
  "id": "NKaqMuZWy3BAcP77RdkEEv",
  "transactions": [

  ],
  "btcPaid": "0.0000",
  "rate": 395.2,
  "exceptionStatus": false,
  "token": "9kZgUXFb5AC6qMuLaMpP9WopbM8X2UjMhkphKKdaprRbSKgUJNE6JNTX8bGsmgxKKv",
  "buyer": {
  }
}
```

There are many options available when creating invoices, which are listed in the [BitPay API documentation](https://bitpay.com/bitcoin-payment-gateway-api).

### Get invoice status

The ruby library provides two methods for fetching an existing invoice:

    # For authorized clients with a 'merchant' token
    client.get_invoice(id: 'PvVhgBfA7wKPWhuVC24rJo')
    
    # For non-authenticated clients (public facade)
    # Returns the public subset of invoice fields
    client.get_public_invoice(id: 'PvVhgBfA7wKPWhuVC24rJo')

### Create a refund request

Clients with a `merchant` token can initiate a refund request for a paid invoice:

    client.refund_invoice(id: '6pbV13VBZfGFJ8BBmXmLZ8', params: {amount: 10, currency: 'USD'})
    
Refund rules:

 * Invoices cannot be refunded prior to 6 blockchain confirmations
 * Invoices without `["flags"]["refundable"] == true` must specify a `bitcoinAddress` param (one was not provided as part of the transaction)
 * Invoices that are paid in full must specify an `amount` and `currency` param to indicate the amount to be refunded

### View Refund Requests

The ruby library provides two methods for viewing refund requests.  Both require a `merchant` token.

    # To get an array of all refunds against a specific invoice
    client.get_all_refunds_for_invoice(id: 'PvVhgBfA7wKPWhuVC24rJo')
    
    # To get a specific refund for a specific invoice
    client.get_refund(id: 'JB49z2MsDH7FunczeyDS8j', request_id: '4evCrXq4EDXk4oqDXdWQhX')

### Make a HTTP request directly against the REST API

For API tasks which lack a dedicated library method, BitPay provides a method that will automatically apply the proper cryptographic parameters to a request.

    client.send_request("GET", "/invoices/JB49z2MsDH7FunczeyDS8j", facade: 'merchant')
    
Usage:
 * Specify HTTP verb and REST endpoint
 * Specifying a `facade` will fetch and apply the corresponding `token`
 * Alternatively provide a `token` explicitly
 * For `POST` requests, the `params` hash will be included as the message body

## Testnet Usage

During development and testing, take advantage of the [Bitcoin TestNet](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Testnet) by passing a custom `api_uri` option on initialization:

    BitPay::SDK::Client.new({api_uri: "https://test.bitpay.com/api"})
    
Note that in order to pair with testnet, you will need a pairing code from test.bitpay.com and will need to use the bitpay client with the --test option.

## API Documentation

API Documentation is available on the [BitPay site](https://bitpay.com/api).

## Running the Tests

In order to run the tests, you must have phantomjs installed and on your PATH.

The tests require that environment variables be set for the bitpay server, user name, and password. First run:
    
    $ source ./spec/set_constants.sh https://test.bitpay.com <yourusername> <yourpassword>
    $ bundle install
    $ bundle exec rake

Tests are likely to run up against rate limiters on test.bitpay.com if used too frequently. Rake tasks which interact directly with BitPay will not run for the general public.

_Note that because of rate-limits applied on the API endpoints, you may experience errors when the tests are run repeatedly in a short timeframe._

In addition to a full test suite, there is Travis integration for MRI 1.9, JRuby and Rubinius.
